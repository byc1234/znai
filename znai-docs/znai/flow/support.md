It is very useful to provide a way to contact an owner of a documentation, so he/she can get a feedback about the documentation from a reader. When a user defines a link in meta.json, Support link will show up under a page title if you define a `link` under `support`. 

:include-json: ../meta.json {highlight: [9, 10, 11]}
